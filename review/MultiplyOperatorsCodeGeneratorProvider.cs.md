# Issues found in src/Thinktecture.Runtime.Extensions.SourceGenerator/CodeAnalysis/ValueObjects/MultiplyOperatorsCodeGeneratorProvider.cs

- Warning (nullable flow): The out parameter is annotated with [MaybeNullWhen(false)] but lacks a guarantee for non-null on success. This weakens NRT flow analysis for consumers of TryGet.
  - Impact: Callers wonâ€™t get compile-time assurance that generator is non-null when the method returns true, leading to redundant null checks or suppressed warnings.
  - Recommendation: Prefer [NotNullWhen(true)] to express the non-null contract on success (typically used instead of MaybeNullWhen(false) for out-params in Try-patterns). Example:
    public bool TryGet(ImplementedOperators keyMemberOperators, OperatorsGeneration operatorsGeneration, [NotNullWhen(true)] out IInterfaceCodeGenerator generator)

- Warning (design/encapsulation): Class is public and not sealed while implementing a singleton pattern (private constructor + static Instance).
  - Impact: Allows unintended inheritance that can break assumptions around a single provider instance and complicate registration/discovery.
  - Recommendation: Mark the class as sealed to prevent inheritance:
    public sealed class MultiplyOperatorsCodeGeneratorProvider : IOperatorsCodeGeneratorProvider
