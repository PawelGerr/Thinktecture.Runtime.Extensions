- Error: Invalid interface declaration. The non-generic interface is declared with a trailing semicolon and no body:
  public interface IInterfaceCodeGenerator : IInterfaceCodeGenerator<InterfaceCodeGeneratorState>;
  In C#, interface declarations must have a body (even if empty). Suggested fix:
  public interface IInterfaceCodeGenerator : IInterfaceCodeGenerator<InterfaceCodeGeneratorState> { }

- Verified: The generic interface uses contravariance correctly (in TState) since TState is only consumed as a parameter in methods; no issue here.
