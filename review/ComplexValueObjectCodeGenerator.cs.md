ComplexValueObjectCodeGenerator.cs – Issues

1) All instances become equal when no equality members are configured
- Severity: Warning (correctness/perf)
- Location: GenerateEquals and GenerateGetHashCode
- Details:
  - If _state.EqualityMembers.Count == 0, Equals returns true and GetHashCode returns 0 for all instances.
  - This collapses all instances into a single equivalence class and creates catastrophic hash collisions in dictionaries/sets.
- Suggested fix:
  - Prefer a safer fallback:
    - For reference types: use reference equality (return ReferenceEquals(this, other)) and base.GetHashCode() or RuntimeHelpers.GetHashCode(this).
    - For value types: return true only if all assignable members count is 0 and optionally document this; or consider disallowing “no equality members” via analyzer.
  - Alternatively, emit a diagnostic (analyzer) requiring at least one equality member for complex value objects.

2) Default struct creation not prevented when AllowDefaultStructs is false (zero-member structs)
- Severity: Warning (API/semantics)
- Location: GenerateCreateMethod / GenerateValidateMethod / GenerateConstructor
- Details:
  - For structs with no assignable members, Create() constructs new T() unconditionally.
  - Settings.AllowDefaultStructs is only used to expose DefaultInstance; it does not prevent Create() from producing default(T).
  - If default structs are disallowed (e.g., via settings or IDisallowDefaultValue semantics), factories still allow creating default instances for zero-member structs.
- Suggested fix:
  - In Validate(), if !_state.Settings.AllowDefaultStructs and there are no assignable members, set a validation error so Create/TryCreate fails.
  - Or, emit a diagnostic requiring at least one member for structs when AllowDefaultStructs is false.

3) Potentially heavy static initialization for AssignableMembers metadata
- Severity: Info (performance)
- Location: Metadata initialization (AssignableMembers via expression tree)
- Details:
  - Building AssignableMembers uses expression trees + reflection at type initialization time. It’s one-time but alloc-heavy.
- Suggested improvement:
  - Consider generating direct MemberInfo retrieval (typeof(T).GetField/Property with BindingFlags) or caching via precomputed names to reduce expression tree allocations. Current approach is acceptable if initialization cost is negligible.

4) Minor documentation clarity
- Severity: Minor
- Location: Create/TryCreate XML docs
- Details:
  - Parameter docs repeat the same generic phrase “The value to be used for object creation.” for every member; not actionable but reduces clarity in large objects.
- Suggested improvement:
  - Optionally generate per-member descriptions (e.g., include member name), or keep as-is if doc-gen complexity isn’t desired.

Tests to add
- Zero equality members behavior:
  - Verify that two distinct instances are not equal (if you adopt reference-equality fallback) and that GetHashCode is non-constant; or, if keeping current behavior, add explicit tests documenting Equals==true and GetHashCode==0 for all.
- Zero-member struct with AllowDefaultStructs=false:
  - Assert that Create() fails (ValidationException) or TryCreate returns false with a validation error once the guard is added.
- Metadata initialization:
  - Snapshot test AssignableMembers to confirm it includes the intended members and remains stable across refactors.
