- Warning: Incomplete nullability contract on out parameter
  - Location: TryGet(..., [MaybeNullWhen(false)] out IInterfaceCodeGenerator generator)
  - Issue: Only [MaybeNullWhen(false)] is applied. This does not guarantee to consumers that 'generator' is non-null when the method returns true, leading to weaker flow analysis and potential unnecessary null-checks.
  - Impact: Callers may still see 'generator' as possibly null even when TryGet returns true.
  - Suggested fix: Annotate with [NotNullWhen(true)] (optionally in addition to or instead of [MaybeNullWhen(false)]) to make the contract precise:
    public bool TryGet(ImplementedOperators keyMemberOperators,
                       OperatorsGeneration operatorsGeneration,
                       [NotNullWhen(true)] out IInterfaceCodeGenerator generator)
