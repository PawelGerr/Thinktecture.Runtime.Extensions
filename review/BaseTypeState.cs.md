[Design/API] Unnecessarily public type
- BaseTypeState is declared public within the source generator assembly but appears to be an internal implementation detail. Exposing it publicly unnecessarily increases the public API surface and can cause breaking changes later.
- Recommendation: change to internal readonly struct BaseTypeState ...

[Correctness/Robustness] default(BaseTypeState) yields null property and NREs
- Because this is a struct with a primary constructor and a get-only auto-property initialized from the ctor parameter, the default(BaseTypeState) instance will have Constructors == null.
- Equals and GetHashCode both dereference Constructors without null checks, which can throw NullReferenceException if a default instance is ever compared/hashed.
- Recommendations (pick one or combine):
  - Make the type internal (reduces external misuse risk).
  - Null-safe guards in equality and hashing:
    - return (Constructors ?? Array.Empty<ConstructorState>()).SequenceEqual(other.Constructors ?? Array.Empty<ConstructorState>());
    - return (Constructors ?? Array.Empty<ConstructorState>()).ComputeHashCode();
  - Provide an explicit parameterless constructor for structs (C# 10+) to initialize to an empty collection:
    ```
    public BaseTypeState() : this((IReadOnlyList<ConstructorState>)Array.Empty<ConstructorState>()) { }
    ```
    Note: default(BaseTypeState) still bypasses this, so null-safe guards are still advisable.

[Immutability/Equality correctness] No defensive copy; IReadOnlyList does not guarantee immutability
- Constructors is typed as IReadOnlyList<ConstructorState>, which does not prevent the underlying list from being mutated after BaseTypeState construction. Since Equals/GetHashCode depend on the contents, external mutations can violate the immutability expectation of a value-type state and break dictionary/set behavior.
- Recommendations:
  - Store an immutable snapshot:
    - Prefer ImmutableArray<ConstructorState> internally:
      ```
      private readonly ImmutableArray<ConstructorState> _constructors =
          constructors is ImmutableArray<ConstructorState> ia ? ia
          : (constructors?.ToImmutableArray() ?? ImmutableArray<ConstructorState>.Empty);

      public ImmutableArray<ConstructorState> Constructors => _constructors;
      public bool Equals(BaseTypeState other) => _constructors.SequenceEqual(other._constructors);
      public override int GetHashCode() => _constructors.ComputeHashCode();
      ```
  - Alternatively, copy to a new array and wrap with ReadOnlyCollection to prevent external changes:
    ```
    Constructors = (constructors ?? Array.Empty<ConstructorState>()).ToArray();
    ```

[Equality semantics] SequenceEqual relies on ConstructorState equality
- SequenceEqual uses EqualityComparer<ConstructorState>.Default. If ConstructorState is a class without IEquatable/overrides, equality will degrade to reference equality, which is likely incorrect for semantic state comparisons.
- Recommendation: ensure ConstructorState implements IEquatable<ConstructorState> with a consistent GetHashCode, or pass an explicit IEqualityComparer if reference equality is intended.

[Nullability] No guard on constructor parameter
- With nullable reference types enabled, the constructor parameter is reference-typed but not guarded. Passing null will yield Constructors == null and the issues above.
- Recommendation: coalesce or guard:
  - Constructors = constructors ?? Array.Empty<ConstructorState>();
  - Optionally, ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(constructors); if null should be invalid.

[Style/Minor]
- GetHashCode can be simplified:
  ```
  public override int GetHashCode() => (Constructors ?? Array.Empty<ConstructorState>()).ComputeHashCode();
  ```
- operator != can be expressed as return !left.Equals(right); for clarity.

[Build hygiene] Implicit dependency on System.Linq
- SequenceEqual extension requires System.Linq. If ImplicitUsings is disabled for this project, this file will not compile without a using System.Linq;. Verify project settings; otherwise add the explicit using.

[Open question for intent]
- Should constructor order be semantically relevant for equality? If not, consider order-insensitive comparison (e.g., SetComparer) to avoid spurious inequality due to metadata ordering.
