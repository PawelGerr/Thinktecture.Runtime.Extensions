JsonValueObjectCodeGeneratorFactory.cs â€“ Issues

1) CodeGeneratorName may be ambiguous between keyed and complex value objects
- Severity: Minor
- Location: CodeGeneratorName
- Details: Uses the generic name "SystemTextJson-ValueObject-CodeGenerator". Given there are separate code paths for keyed vs complex value objects, the name may be indistinguishable in logs/diagnostics from a keyed variant (if any) and reduce traceability.
- Suggested fix: Consider a more specific name, e.g., "SystemTextJson-ComplexValueObject-CodeGenerator", to align with the specific Create path (ComplexValueObjectJsonCodeGenerator).

2) Equals overloads do not affect default equality semantics and are likely redundant
- Severity: Minor
- Location: Equals overloads at the bottom of the class
- Details: The class defines three Equals overloads for different interface types but does not override object.Equals nor implement IEquatable<T>. In most collection/lookup scenarios, equality will remain reference-based via object.Equals. The overloads only have effect when called explicitly and may be dead code if not used that way.
- Suggested fix:
  - Either remove these overloads to reduce noise, OR
  - Implement IEquatable<JsonValueObjectCodeGeneratorFactory> and override object.Equals/GetHashCode to clearly define value semantics (if desired). For a singleton, reference equality is sufficient; then the overloads can be removed.

3) MustGenerateCode does not consider attribute-level opt-out for System.Text.Json object factories other than UseForSerialization flag
- Severity: Info
- Location: MustGenerateCode
- Details: The check only suppresses generation when an object factory explicitly sets UseForSerialization.Has(SystemTextJson). If there are other attribute-level settings that effectively opt out of System.Text.Json generation (e.g., via a SerializationFrameworks property on the VO attribute), ensure state.SerializationFrameworks has already incorporated those so this method remains correct.
- Suggested fix: If state.SerializationFrameworks is already pre-filtered by attribute settings (likely), no change is needed. Otherwise, ensure those attribute settings are included in state.SerializationFrameworks calculation.

Tests to add
- Naming/traceability: Optional snapshot/logging test to assert the code generator name matches the intended specialized name once updated.
- Factory selection: Unit test that MustGenerateCode returns false when:
  - A JsonConverter attribute is present, or
  - An object factory is present with UseForSerialization including SystemTextJson.
