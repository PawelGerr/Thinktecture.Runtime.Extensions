# Review: CodeAnalysis/UnionConstructorAccessModifier.cs

Issues found (errors/warnings only):

1) Invalid default state (no 0-valued member)
- Problem: default(UnionConstructorAccessModifier) is 0, which is not defined. This can silently introduce an invalid configuration when values are omitted or deserialized from defaults.
- Recommendation: Define a 0-valued member (e.g., None = 0 or Default = 0) or assign one of the existing values (e.g., Private = 0). Add validation/tests to catch undefined values.

2) Powers-of-two values without [Flags] (confusing semantics)
- Problem: Members are assigned bit values (1 << 0, 1 << 2, 1 << 3) but the enum is not marked with [Flags]. This implies bitwise combinability even though access modifiers are mutually exclusive. It also harms readability and suggests a design that wonâ€™t be used.
- Recommendation: If mutually exclusive, use simple consecutive integers (e.g., Private = 0/1, Internal = 1/2, Public = 2/3) and avoid bit shifts. If combinability is intended (unlikely for access modifiers), add [Flags] and document allowed combinations.

3) Gap in values suggests missing/removed member
- Problem: Skipping 1 << 1 creates a hole (values 1, 4, 8). This hints at a removed or future member, complicates reasoning and may break assumptions in switch/range checks.
- Recommendation: Remove the gap by renumbering (if binary compatibility is not yet locked) or explicitly document the reserved slot.

4) Duplication/consistency risk with other access modifier enums
- Problem: The codebase already uses AccessModifier elsewhere (see Constants.ValueObject.DEFAULT_CONSTRUCTOR_ACCESS_MODIFIER). Having a separate UnionConstructorAccessModifier duplicates semantics and invites drift.
- Recommendation: Reuse the existing AccessModifier if possible, or provide a clear mapping layer and tests ensuring consistent behavior across features.
