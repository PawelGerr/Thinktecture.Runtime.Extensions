KeyMemberSettingsExtensions.cs â€“ Issues

- Warning: No validation of settings.KeyMemberName before passing to ArgumentName.Create.
  - Impact: If KeyMemberName is null/empty or not a valid identifier (depending on how settings are constructed/validated), ArgumentName.Create may throw or produce invalid code.
  - Recommendation: Ensure validation/normalization at settings creation time, or add a guard/assert here if not guaranteed upstream.

- Warning: Extension method is defined in namespace Thinktecture while the target type IKeyMemberSettings resides in Thinktecture.CodeAnalysis (imported via using).
  - Impact: Call sites within Thinktecture.CodeAnalysis must have using Thinktecture (or a global using) for this extension to be in scope. Without it, discoverability/use may be inconsistent.
  - Recommendation: Confirm a global using Thinktecture exists across generator projects. If not, consider moving the extension into Thinktecture.CodeAnalysis or add necessary using directives at call sites.

- Warning: No defensive null checks for parameters settings/keyMemberState.
  - Context: Project uses Nullable Reference Types; null-checks are often unnecessary. However, extension methods can be invoked on null receivers at runtime and will throw.
  - Recommendation: If this API can be called from external code paths (reflection/tooling) where nullability contracts are not enforced, consider adding Debug.Assert or [NotNull] contracts or guard clauses. If strictly internal and validated upstream, ignore.
