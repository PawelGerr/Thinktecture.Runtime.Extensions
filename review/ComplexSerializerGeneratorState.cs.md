ComplexSerializerGeneratorState.cs – Issues

1) NumberOfGenerics hardcoded to 0
- Severity: Bug
- Location: Property NumberOfGenerics
- Details: The state implements INamespaceAndName and exposes NumberOfGenerics => 0 while T : IHasGenerics. For generic complex value objects this will report 0 and may break name formatting, file naming, or serializer generation that depends on generic arity.
- Suggested fix: Return Type.NumberOfGenerics instead of 0.

2) SequenceEqual without explicit comparer for AssignableInstanceFieldsAndProperties
- Severity: Warning
- Location: Equals (AssignableInstanceFieldsAndProperties.SequenceEqual(...))
- Details: Equality relies on default EqualityComparer<InstanceMemberInfo>. If InstanceMemberInfo does not implement IEquatable/GetHashCode consistently, comparison becomes reference-based and can diverge from intended semantic equality.
- Suggested fix: Use an explicit comparer (e.g., MemberInformationComparer if applicable), or ensure InstanceMemberInfo implements semantic equality. Likewise ensure ComputeHashCode() for the list uses the same semantics to keep Equals/GetHashCode consistent.

3) Potential redundancy in equality and hashing with ContainingTypes and Type
- Severity: Minor
- Location: Equals/GetHashCode
- Details: TypeInformationComparer likely incorporates containing type context. Additionally comparing/hashing ContainingTypes may be redundant and double-counts that aspect. Not incorrect but adds noise and small overhead.
- Suggested fix: If TypeInformationComparer already accounts for ContainingTypes, remove the separate ContainingTypes comparisons/hashes to reduce redundancy. Otherwise keep as-is.

Tests to add
- Generic type arity: For a generic complex VO, assert NumberOfGenerics equals the target type’s arity (and that any consumers using it behave correctly).
- InstanceMemberInfo equality: Unit test state equality for two states with equal-but-distinct InstanceMemberInfo instances to verify semantic equality works; add explicit comparer or equality on InstanceMemberInfo if needed.
