MessagePackValueObjectCodeGeneratorFactory.cs â€“ Issues

1) CodeGeneratorName may be ambiguous between keyed and complex value objects
- Severity: Minor
- Location: CodeGeneratorName
- Details: Uses the generic name "MessagePack-ValueObject-CodeGenerator". Given this factory produces code for complex value objects (Create returns ComplexValueObjectMessagePackCodeGenerator), the name may be indistinguishable in logs/diagnostics from a keyed variant and reduce traceability.
- Suggested fix: Use a more specific name, e.g., "MessagePack-ComplexValueObject-CodeGenerator", aligning with the actual generator created.

2) Equals overloads are redundant and do not affect default equality semantics
- Severity: Minor
- Location: Three Equals overloads at the bottom
- Details: The class defines Equals for various factory interfaces but does not implement IEquatable<MessagePackValueObjectCodeGeneratorFactory> nor override object.Equals/GetHashCode. In standard usage, equality remains reference-based. These overloads only apply when explicitly invoked and are likely dead code.
- Suggested fix:
  - Remove the interface-specific Equals overloads to reduce noise; rely on reference equality for the singleton Instance.
  - Alternatively, implement IEquatable<MessagePackValueObjectCodeGeneratorFactory> and override object.Equals/GetHashCode if value-based semantics are required (unlikely for a singleton).

3) MustGenerateCode guard relies solely on ObjectFactory.UseForSerialization
- Severity: Info
- Location: MustGenerateCode
- Details: Suppresses generation when an object factory explicitly opts in to MessagePack via UseForSerialization.Has(MessagePack). If other attribute-level knobs exist to opt out of MessagePack generation (e.g., SerializationFrameworks property on the VO attribute), ensure state.SerializationFrameworks has already been narrowed accordingly.
- Suggested fix: If state.SerializationFrameworks already reflects attribute-level opt-outs (likely), no change is required. Otherwise, incorporate those settings when constructing the state.

Tests to add
- Naming/traceability (optional): Assert the generator name is the specialized name once updated.
- Factory selection:
  - MustGenerateCode returns false when HasMessagePackFormatterAttribute is true.
  - MustGenerateCode returns false when any object factory specifies UseForSerialization includes MessagePack.
  - MustGenerateCode returns true when none of the above applies and SerializationFrameworks includes MessagePack.
