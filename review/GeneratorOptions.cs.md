Issues found in GeneratorOptions.cs

1) Error: Possible NullReferenceException in GetHashCode when Logging is null
- Problem: Logging is nullable (LoggingOptions? Logging), but GetHashCode calls Logging.GetHashCode() unconditionally.
  This will throw at runtime if Logging is null.
- Current code:
  unchecked
  {
     return (CounterEnabled.GetHashCode() * 397)
            ^ (GenerateJetbrainsAnnotations.GetHashCode() * 397)
            ^ Logging.GetHashCode();
  }
- Fix options:
  - Null-safe hash:
    unchecked
    {
       return (CounterEnabled.GetHashCode() * 397)
              ^ (GenerateJetbrainsAnnotations.GetHashCode() * 397)
              ^ (Logging?.GetHashCode() ?? 0);
    }
  - Or use the framework helper that handles nulls:
    return HashCode.Combine(CounterEnabled, GenerateJetbrainsAnnotations, Logging);

2) Warning: Identifier casing inconsistency
- Property name GenerateJetbrainsAnnotations uses Jetbrains instead of JetBrains.
- Suggested rename (non-breaking if internal, otherwise consider API impact): GenerateJetBrainsAnnotations.
- Note: Aligns with branding and improves readability; not functionally incorrect.

3) Warning: Missing == and != operators for a value-like options type
- The type implements IEquatable<GeneratorOptions> and overrides Equals/GetHashCode but does not provide ==/!= operators.
- Not strictly required, but adding them can prevent surprising behavior when consumers expect value semantics:
  public static bool operator ==(GeneratorOptions? left, GeneratorOptions? right) => Equals(left, right);
  public static bool operator !=(GeneratorOptions? left, GeneratorOptions? right) => !Equals(left, right);
