- Magic boolean in base constructor: The call `: base(false)` is not self-documenting. Readers cannot infer the meaning of `false`, increasing risk of misconfiguration during future changes.
  - Suggested fix: Use a named argument if possible (e.g., `base(isForStructs: false)`), or replace the boolean with an enum/typed options to make intent explicit.

- Public API surface may be broader than necessary: The class and its `Instance` field are `public`. If this factory is only used within the source generator assembly, this unnecessarily expands the public surface and creates long-term compatibility constraints.
  - Suggested fix: Make the class and `Instance` `internal` (and ensure `IKeyedSerializerCodeGeneratorFactory` visibility matches) unless there is a concrete external usage requirement.

- Singleton exposed as a public static field: Exposing a singleton via a `public static readonly` field provides less flexibility (e.g., for lazy initialization, instrumentation, or replacement in tests) and may be inconsistent with other factories.
  - Suggested fix: Prefer a property (`public static JsonSmartEnumCodeGeneratorFactory Instance { get; } = new();`) or an internal accessor for consistency and future extensibility.

- Hard-coded generator name literal: `public override string CodeGeneratorName => "SystemTextJson-SmartEnum-CodeGenerator";` is a raw string. If other factories use similar literals, there is a risk of drift and typos across the codebase.
  - Suggested fix: Extract to a `const`/static field or centralize naming conventions to ensure consistency (e.g., `private const string Name = "SystemTextJson-SmartEnum-CodeGenerator";` and return `Name`).
