- Warning: Equality contract is defined on this derived interface (IEquatable<IComplexSerializerCodeGeneratorFactory>) rather than on the common base (ICodeGeneratorFactory). This can cause inconsistent equality semantics when instances are referenced via the base interface. Consider standardizing equality at the base level (e.g., `public interface ICodeGeneratorFactory : IEquatable<ICodeGeneratorFactory>`) and removing per-derived-interface equality to ensure consistency across factory types.

- Warning: Potential reliance on implicit usings. The file references IEquatable<T> without a `using System;` directive or fully qualified name. If ImplicitUsings are disabled, this will not compile. Mitigation: add `using System;` at the top or use `System.IEquatable<IComplexSerializerCodeGeneratorFactory>`.
