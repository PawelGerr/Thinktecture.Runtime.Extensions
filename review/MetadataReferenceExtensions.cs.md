MetadataReferenceExtensions.cs – Issues

- Warning: Null input returns empty result silently.
  - Details: The switch expression has a catch-all arm `_ => []`. If `metadataReference` is null, the method returns an empty collection instead of failing fast.
  - Impact: Masks programming errors and can lead to incomplete module discovery without any signal.
  - Recommendation: Add an explicit `null => throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(metadataReference))` arm, or remove the `_` arm and let nulls surface as NRE with a clearer guard at the beginning.

- Warning: Unknown/unsupported MetadataReference kinds are silently ignored.
  - Details: The `_ => []` arm also swallows any future/unknown `MetadataReference` types.
  - Impact: If Roslyn introduces additional reference types (or custom implementations exist), the method will quietly return no modules, making diagnostics harder.
  - Recommendation: Replace with a throwing arm, e.g., `_ => throw new NotSupportedException($"Unsupported reference type: {metadataReference.GetType().FullName}")`, or at least log via the project’s logging facility.

- Warning: No handling for ModuleMetadata-backed PortableExecutableReference (netmodule).
  - Details: `PortableExecutableReference.GetMetadata()` can return `ModuleMetadata` for netmodules; only `AssemblyMetadata` is handled, others fall into `_ => []`.
  - Impact: Modules from netmodule references are missed entirely.
  - Recommendation: Either handle `ModuleMetadata` (derive module name via metadata reader) or explicitly throw `NotSupportedException` to avoid silent loss.

- Warning: Extension method namespace vs. discoverability.
  - Details: The extension is defined in namespace `Thinktecture`, while the extended Roslyn types are in `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis`.
  - Impact: Call sites must have `using Thinktecture;` in scope. If not consistently configured (e.g., via global using), this reduces discoverability.
  - Recommendation: Ensure a global using is present for the generator project(s), or relocate to a dedicated extensions namespace that is globally imported.

- Minor: XML doc mismatch/clarity.
  - Details: `<exception cref="FileNotFoundException">MissingMetadataReference throws if DLL could not be loaded.</exception>` mentions “MissingMetadataReference” (likely a custom type) while the cref is `FileNotFoundException`.
  - Impact: Confusing documentation; unclear which exception is thrown by whom.
  - Recommendation: Clarify the wording, e.g., “`GetMetadata` may throw `FileNotFoundException` if the DLL cannot be loaded.” Use consistent exception references or provide a second `<exception>` for the custom type if actually thrown upstream.
