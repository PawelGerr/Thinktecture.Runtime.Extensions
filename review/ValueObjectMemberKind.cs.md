Issues found in src/Thinktecture.Runtime.Extensions.SourceGenerator/CodeAnalysis/ValueObjectMemberKind.cs

1) Error: Type/file name mismatch and inconsistency with established naming
- File path and review plan indicate ValueObjectMemberKind.cs, but the declared type is enum MemberKind.
- This deviates from the naming pattern used elsewhere (e.g., ValueObjectAccessModifier, UnionConstructorAccessModifier) and reduces discoverability.
- Risk: Confusion when searching by filename/type, potential ambiguity if other “MemberKind” enums exist.
- Fix: Rename the enum to ValueObjectMemberKind (preferred), or rename the file and update all references accordingly.

2) Warning: Public API surface may be unintentionally exposed
- The enum is declared public. If it’s an internal implementation detail for the generator, this should be internal to avoid expanding the package’s public API.
- Risk: Binary compatibility constraints and unintended external usage.
- Fix: Change to internal unless there is a proven need for external consumers.

3) Warning: Overly generic type name raises collision/clarity risks
- MemberKind is generic and can easily collide or confuse with similar concepts across other generator families (SmartEnums, Unions, etc.).
- Fix: If keeping it public or shared, prefer a more specific name (ValueObjectMemberKind) or move into a narrower namespace scope (e.g., Thinktecture.CodeAnalysis.ValueObjects).
