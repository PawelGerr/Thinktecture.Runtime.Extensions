1) Reliance on enum ordinal ordering for operator coupling
- Location: Constructor
- Code: 
  // Comparison operators depend on the equality comparison operators
  if (ComparisonOperators > EqualityComparisonOperators)
     EqualityComparisonOperators = ComparisonOperators;
- Details: This uses the relational operator (>) on OperatorsGeneration to enforce that equality is at least as permissive as comparison. This only works correctly if OperatorsGeneration values are intentionally ordered to reflect “capability strength” and never used as [Flags]. If OperatorsGeneration is or becomes a flags enum, or its ordering changes, this comparison becomes incorrect and brittle.
- Impact: Misconfiguration propagation: Choosing ComparisonOperators could silently force an unintended EqualityComparisonOperators value or fail to enforce the intended constraint in future changes.
- Suggested fix: Replace ordinal comparison with an explicit, domain-aware check, for example:
  - Define a helper method that computes the required equality set from the selected comparison set (mapping enum values to required equality values).
  - If OperatorsGeneration is a flags enum, use bitwise inclusion checks instead of ordering.

2) Potential null-dereference in GetHashCode for string properties
- Location: GetHashCode
- Code: `.GetHashCode()` on `KeyMemberName`, `CreateFactoryMethodName`, `TryCreateFactoryMethodName`, `DefaultInstancePropertyName`
- Details: These properties are non-null due to constructor defaults, but if attribute parsing is ever expanded or a future change introduces a null path, the hash computation would throw.
- Impact: Hard crash during incremental execution under edge cases/regressions.
- Suggested fix: Either:
  - Keep the non-null contract and add Debug.Assert(...) in the constructor after assignments; or
  - Use null-conditional with coalescing for extra safety, mirroring the defensive style used for other nullable fields in the codebase.
