# Review: CodeAnalysis/ValueObjectAccessModifier.cs (enum AccessModifier)

Issues found (errors/warnings only):

1) Invalid default state (no 0-valued member)
- Problem: default(AccessModifier) is 0, which is not defined. This can silently introduce invalid configuration when an option is omitted or default(T) is used.
- Recommendation: Add a 0-valued member (e.g., None = 0 or Default = 0) or assign one of the existing values to 0. Add validation/tests to catch undefined values.

2) Bitmask semantics without [Flags]
- Problem: Members use powers-of-two and define composite values (PrivateProtected = Private | Protected, ProtectedInternal = Protected | Internal) but the enum is not annotated with [Flags]. This obscures intent and can impact display/diagnostics (Enum.ToString) and developer expectations.
- Recommendation: Add [Flags] to reflect intended combinability. If combinability is NOT intended, avoid bit-shift values and OR-composites; use simple sequential integers and treat “PrivateProtected”/“ProtectedInternal” as distinct, non-combinable values.

3) Allowing invalid combinations (if [Flags] is added or bitwise ops are used)
- Problem: Nothing prevents nonsensical combinations (e.g., Private | Public). Even today, bitwise ops can create undefined states that won’t match a named member, degrading logs and correctness.
- Recommendation: Constrain allowed values at parse/validation boundaries. If using [Flags], validate only the set {Private, Protected, Internal, Public, PrivateProtected, ProtectedInternal} and reject others.

4) Duplication/consistency risk with UnionConstructorAccessModifier
- Problem: Another enum defines access levels for union constructors with separate bit values. This duplicates semantics and risks drift.
- Recommendation: Make AccessModifier the canonical access enum and map union-specific options to it, or remove UnionConstructorAccessModifier and reuse AccessModifier directly. Ensure tests cover the mapping.
