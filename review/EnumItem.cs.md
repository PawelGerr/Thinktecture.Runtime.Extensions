- Warning: GetHashCode uses string.GetHashCode(), which is process-randomized and implicitly ordinal. For explicitness and to ensure consistency with the ordinal equality semantics (Name == other.Name), prefer StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode(Name). This makes intent clear and avoids accidental cultural semantics if code is refactored.
  Suggested change:
  public override int GetHashCode() => StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode(Name);

- Nit: The file references IFieldSymbol without an explicit using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis; and likely depends on global usings. If global usings are removed/refactored, this file will not compile. Consider adding an explicit using for clarity and resilience.

- Nit: ArgumentName is derived solely from Name and stored alongside it. If ever constructed inconsistently, equality/hash only consider Name, which could hide state divergence. Either document the invariant that ArgumentName must be derived from Name or compute it on demand to avoid duplicate state.
