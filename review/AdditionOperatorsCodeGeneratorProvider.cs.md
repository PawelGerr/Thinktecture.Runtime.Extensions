AdditionOperatorsCodeGeneratorProvider.cs — Issues

1) Try-pattern nullability contract mirrors interface but is suboptimal
- Issue: Method uses [MaybeNullWhen(false)] on a non-nullable out parameter (IInterfaceCodeGenerator generator).
- Risk: Forces implementations/callers into assigning null to a non-nullable variable when returning false, which can cause warnings and is atypical for Try-patterns.
- Recommendation: Align with the common Try-pattern and simplify caller experience:
  - public bool TryGet(ImplementedOperators keyMemberOperators, OperatorsGeneration operatorsGeneration, [NotNullWhen(true)] out IInterfaceCodeGenerator? generator);
- Note: This change should be made on the interface IOperatorsCodeGeneratorProvider as well to avoid signature mismatch.

2) Public API surface (design)
- Observation: The class is public; if providers are intended for internal wiring within the SourceGenerator assembly only, prefer internal to minimize public API surface and future compatibility obligations.
- Recommendation: internal sealed class AdditionOperatorsCodeGeneratorProvider

3) Minor: Instance exposure type
- Observation: Instance is exposed as IOperatorsCodeGeneratorProvider rather than the concrete type. This is fine, but if consumers ever need the concrete type (currently they don’t), consider exposing as the concrete type and let callers use it as interface. Not a correctness issue, just an API style note.
- Severity: Suggestion
