- Warning: Equality contract is defined on this derived interface (IEquatable<IKeyedSerializerCodeGeneratorFactory>) instead of the common base (ICodeGeneratorFactory). This can lead to inconsistent equality behavior when instances are referenced via the base interface. Consider standardizing equality at the base level (e.g., ICodeGeneratorFactory : IEquatable<ICodeGeneratorFactory>) to ensure consistency across factories and simplify usage.

- Warning: Potential reliance on implicit usings. The file references IEquatable<T> without a using System; directive or fully-qualified name. If ImplicitUsings are disabled in the project, this will fail to compile. Mitigation: add `using System;` at the top of the file or change to `System.IEquatable<IKeyedSerializerCodeGeneratorFactory>`.
