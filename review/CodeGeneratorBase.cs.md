Issues found in src/Thinktecture.Runtime.Extensions.SourceGenerator/CodeAnalysis/CodeGeneratorBase.cs

- GENERATED_CODE_PREFIX lacks guaranteed trailing newline(s):
  - The verbatim string ends right after `#nullable enable` without an explicit trailing newline. If concatenated with the first emitted code token (e.g., `namespace`), it may produce invalid code like `#nullable enablenamespace ...`.
  - Recommendation: Append at least one newline (often two) after `#nullable enable` to ensure the next token starts on a new line, e.g. `@"// <auto-generated />\r\n#nullable enable\r\n\r\n"`.

- Platform-dependent line endings in verbatim literal:
  - Embedding line breaks directly inside a verbatim string bakes in whatever newline sequence is in the source file. On cross-platform dev or CI environments with different line-ending normalization, this can yield inconsistent output.
  - Recommendation: Build the prefix using `Environment.NewLine` or a shared constant consistent with repository policy, or normalize line endings at write time.

- Missing GeneratedCodeAttribute on generated files:
  - Only the comment `// <auto-generated />` is emitted. Some analyzers rely on `[GeneratedCode]`/`[CompilerGenerated]` attributes to suppress diagnostics in generated code.
  - Recommendation: Consider adding `System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute` (and/or `CompilerGeneratedAttribute`) at an appropriate scope to improve analyzer integration where needed.

- Abstract API provides no output channel contract:
  - `Generate(CancellationToken)` does not define how/where to emit the generated code (e.g., returning a string, using a writer, or pushing to a context). This can lead to tight coupling to external/global state and makes testing harder.
  - Recommendation: Consider returning the generated source (string or structured object), or pass an explicit output sink/interface to improve testability and decouple emission from orchestration.
