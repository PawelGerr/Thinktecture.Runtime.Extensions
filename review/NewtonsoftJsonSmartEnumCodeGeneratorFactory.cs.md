- Magic boolean in base constructor: The call `: base(false)` is not self-documenting. The meaning of `false` is unclear to readers and future contributors.
  - Suggested fix: Use a named argument if available (e.g., `base(isForStructs: false)`), or replace the boolean with an enum/typed options to make intent explicit.

- Public API surface may be broader than necessary: The class and its `Instance` field are `public`. If this factory is only used within the source generator assembly, this widens the public surface area and imposes compatibility constraints.
  - Suggested fix: Make the class and `Instance` `internal` unless there is a known external consumer. Ensure `IKeyedSerializerCodeGeneratorFactory` visibility aligns with the change.

- Singleton exposed as a public static field: `public static readonly IKeyedSerializerCodeGeneratorFactory Instance = new NewtonsoftJsonSmartEnumCodeGeneratorFactory();`
  - Concerns: Limits flexibility for lazy initialization, test substitution, or instrumentation. Check consistency with the other serializer factories.
  - Suggested fix: Prefer a property (e.g., `public static NewtonsoftJsonSmartEnumCodeGeneratorFactory Instance { get; } = new();`) or an internal accessor. Consider exposing the concrete type if consumers need factory-specific behavior.

- Hard-coded generator name literal: `public override string CodeGeneratorName => "NewtonsoftJson-SmartEnum-CodeGenerator";` is a magic string.
  - Suggested fix: Extract to a `const`/static field or centralize naming (e.g., a shared constants class) to avoid naming drift across factories and aid discovery.

- Cross-factory consistency: Ensure this factory mirrors the System.Text.Json and MessagePack counterparts in accessibility, naming, and initialization style.
  - Suggested fix: If other factories adopt named args, internal visibility, and constant names, align this file accordingly to reduce maintenance risks.
