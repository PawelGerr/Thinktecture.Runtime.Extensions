Issues found in src/Thinktecture.Runtime.Extensions.SourceGenerator/CodeAnalysis/InterfaceCodeGeneratorFactory.cs

- Missing constructor and parameter validation:
  - The constructor does not validate `interfaceCodeGenerator`. Passing null (via misuse/reflection) will cause NRE on `CodeGeneratorName` or in `Create`.
  - `Create(T state, StringBuilder stringBuilder)` does not validate `state` or `stringBuilder`. Misuse can lead to NRE in downstream code generation.
  - Recommendation: Add `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(interfaceCodeGenerator);` in ctor, and `ThrowIfNull` for `state`/`stringBuilder` in `Create`.

- Equality method that doesnâ€™t participate in .NET equality:
  - `public bool Equals(ICodeGeneratorFactory<T> other)` returns `ReferenceEquals(this, other)` but does not implement `IEquatable<InterfaceCodeGeneratorFactory<T, TType>>` nor override `object.Equals/GetHashCode`.
  - Impact: Collections (Dictionary/HashSet) will not use this overload; they rely on `object.Equals`. This can lead to unexpected behavior if callers assume this method affects equality.
  - Recommendation: Either remove this method to avoid confusion, or implement proper equality: override `Equals(object)`/`GetHashCode()`, or implement `IEquatable<...>` with clear semantics. If reference identity is intended, rely on default `object` behavior and drop the method.

- Potentially unnecessary namespace import:
  - `using Thinktecture.CodeAnalysis.SmartEnums;` appears unused by the symbols in this file (operators and generator states reside under `CodeAnalysis`).
  - Recommendation: Remove the unused using to reduce noise.

- Allocation patterns for Comparable with accessor:
  - `Comparable(string? comparerAccessor)` allocates a new factory instance for each non-empty accessor. If called frequently with repeated accessors, this may cause churn.
  - Recommendation: If practical, cache factories per accessor (e.g., dictionary) to avoid repeated allocations. Assess via profiling first.

- Style consistency:
  - Uses `String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace` instead of `string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace`, which is inconsistent with typical C# style in the codebase.
  - Recommendation: Prefer keyword alias `string`.

- API surface clarity:
  - `CodeGeneratorName` proxies through to the inner `_interfaceCodeGenerator`. If the name is used for diagnostics or file naming, ensure consumers know the name comes from the underlying generator, not the factory, to avoid surprises.
  - Recommendation: Document or rename to make provenance explicit if confusion arises.
