Issues found in ITypeInformationProvider.cs

1) Warning: Property name may conflict with System.Type
- Problem: The property is named `Type`, which can be confused with `System.Type` in consuming code and diagnostics.
- Risk: Reduced readability and potential qualification noise (`global::System.Type` vs domain type info).
- Fix options:
  - Rename to `TypeInfo` or `TypeInformation` for clarity. If public API, evaluate impact and consider an obsoleted alias.

2) Warning: Insufficient contract in generic constraint
- Problem: `T` is constrained to `ITypeFullyQualified` and `INamespaceAndName` only. Many consumers of type info (generators) also need kind/nullability/minimal-name information.
- Risk: Downcasts or re-queries of Roslyn symbols elsewhere, causing duplication and inconsistency.
- Fix options:
  - Consider extending constraints to include `ITypeKindInformation`, `ITypeMinimallyQualified`, and/or `ITypeInformation` (if that aggregates required facets).
  - Alternatively, document clearly what guarantees `T` provides and where to obtain the rest.

3) Warning: Ambiguity of non-null contract
- Problem: The property `T Type { get; }` is non-nullable, but the interface does not document that it must never be null or when it could be unavailable (lazy init failure, not found, etc.).
- Risk: Implementations may return null via `default!` or consumers may need redundant checks.
- Fix options:
  - Document invariant "never null" and ensure implementations enforce it, or change to `T?` with a defined failure mode (and consider adding a `TryGet(out T type)` pattern if discovery can fail).

4) Suggestion: Provider pattern minimalism
- Observation: The interface is effectively a wrapper around a single property. If this exists primarily to unify access in pipelines, consider whether it provides enough value or if `T` could be passed directly.
- Option:
  - Keep if it decouples lifetime or lazy computation; otherwise consider removing the provider layer or expanding with operations (e.g., `Refresh()`, context-aware retrieval) if needed.

5) Suggestion: XML docs for invariants and threading
- Problem: No guidance on caching/thread-safety/lifetime for `Type`.
- Impact: Implementations may recompute and allocate repeatedly during generation, or expose mutable state.
- Fix options:
  - Document that `Type` should be computed once and cached (if expensive), and whether the provider is thread-safe for parallel generator execution.
