# Thinktecture.Runtime.Extensions.SourceGenerator.csproj.DotSettings – Review

Summary:
- Project-scoped JetBrains Rider/ReSharper settings that customize namespace inference for this project. The file contains a single setting to exclude the folder “Extensions” from contributing to namespaces when ReSharper suggests/adjusts namespaces.

Observed content (normalized):
- /Default/CodeInspection/NamespaceProvider/NamespaceFoldersToSkip/=extensions/@EntryIndexedValue = True

Findings:
- No errors found.
- Warnings:
  - Scope/intent verification: The project contains a folder `src/Thinktecture.Runtime.Extensions.SourceGenerator/Extensions/` and files within use namespaces without an `.Extensions` suffix (e.g., `StringExtensions.cs` uses `namespace Thinktecture;`). The setting “NamespaceFoldersToSkip=extensions” aligns with this convention and prevents Rider/ReSharper from prompting to include `Extensions` in the namespace. This is correct and intentional.
  - Cross-solution consistency: The solution-level DotSettings (`Thinktecture.Runtime.Extensions.sln.DotSettings`) only defines custom dictionary words and has no namespace provider settings. If other projects in the solution also use an `Extensions` folder with the same namespace convention, consider moving or duplicating this setting at the solution level for consistency.
  - Potential additional folders: The project contains other folders (e.g., `Generated`, `Properties`, `Logging`, `Json`, `CodeAnalysis`). Only `Extensions` appears intended to be skipped. Do not skip `CodeAnalysis`, `Logging`, or `Json` as they reflect actual namespaces in code (e.g., `Thinktecture.CodeAnalysis`, `Thinktecture.Logging`). Skipping `Generated` is optional if you want to ensure generated sample sources do not pressure namespace suggestions; however, it is not necessary in this repository and could hide misplacements if enabled inadvertently.
  - JetBrains XML namespace prefix: The XML uses `xmlns:ss="urn:shemas-jetbrains-com:settings-storage-xaml"`, which matches the pattern used elsewhere in this repo (also present in the solution-level .DotSettings). This appears to be the expected format for JetBrains settings files in this repository and is consistent; no action required.
- Consistency with repository configuration:
  - .editorconfig (root): Only configures verify-related artifacts; no conflicts.
  - src/.editorconfig: Sets `dotnet_diagnostic.CA1852.severity = warning`; unrelated to Rider namespace provider; no conflict.
  - Directory.Build.props (root + src): Sets global MSBuild options (nullable enabled, implicit usings, language version, etc.). No overlap with Rider settings; no conflict.
  - Solution-level DotSettings: Only user dictionary words; no overlap.

Suggestions & Fixes:
- Keep the `NamespaceFoldersToSkip` for `extensions`; it is appropriate for the project’s namespace conventions.
- Optional: If other projects also use an `Extensions` folder that should be excluded from namespaces, consider moving this setting to `Thinktecture.Runtime.Extensions.sln.DotSettings` (or duplicating per project) for cross-project consistency.
- Optional: If you find Rider prompting namespace changes for files under `Generated` (and you do not want that), add `generated` to the skip list. Be cautious to avoid masking misplaced files that should have explicit namespaces.
- Document team convention: Consider noting in CLAUDE.md (or contributing docs) that `Extensions` folders are excluded from namespaces via JetBrains settings so contributors using Rider/ReSharper see consistent behavior.

Notes:
- This setting is IDE-specific (JetBrains) and has no effect on Roslyn analyzers or build. It is safe to keep in source control to enforce consistent IDE behavior across the team.
- No redundancies, conflicts, obsolete or machine-specific entries detected.
- No issues found. The single setting matches the observed folder structure and namespace conventions, and does not conflict with .editorconfig or MSBuild props.
