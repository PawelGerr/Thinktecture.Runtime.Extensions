- Fragile comparer accessor contract:
  - In `GenerateKeyMemberEqualityComparison`, when a comparer accessor is provided the code emits `[accessor].EqualityComparer.Equals(...)`. If the accessor already denotes an `IEqualityComparer<T>` (e.g., `StringComparer.Ordinal` or a custom comparer instance), appending `.EqualityComparer` is invalid.
  - Recommendation: Pass a structured payload (e.g., `ComparerInfo` with `IsAccessor`/`IsComparer`), or require the provided accessor to already be the final comparer expression and call `.Equals(...)` directly without suffixing. Align with fixes suggested for other generators.

- Hardcoded string equality semantics:
  - For string keys, equality uses `StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase`. This can diverge from configured equality semantics for value objects/smart enums (often `Ordinal` is expected unless explicitly overridden), leading to inconsistencies between operators, Equals, and comparer-based logic.
  - Recommendation: Prefer an explicitly configured comparer when present; otherwise use `StringComparer.Ordinal` as a safer default, or make the behavior fully configurable.

- Potential null-dereference of `other`:
  - The generator assumes `other` is non-null when accessing `other.<Key>`. While in practice this helper is likely invoked inside an `Equals` implementation that already guards against null, the helper itself does not enforce or document the assumption.
  - Recommendation: Document preconditions (e.g., “caller guarantees non-null `other`”), or include minimal `other is null` handling in the emitted code for robustness.

- Reference-type key null handling covers `this.<Key>` only:
  - For reference-type keys, the generated code checks `this.<Key> is null ? other.<Key> is null : this.<Key>.Equals(other.<Key>)`. If `other` was null (see previous issue) this will throw; additionally, if `other.<Key>` is accessed before null-check of `other`, it also throws.
  - Recommendation: Rely on earlier `other` null guards and consider generating symmetrical null checks on both sides where applicable, or explicitly state the assumption.

- Minor formatting/indentation coupling:
  - `GenerateKeyMember` relies on embedded spaces/newlines and then calls `.RenderAccessModifier(...)` immediately after a string literal ending with indentation spaces. This assumes `RenderAccessModifier` does not add its own leading whitespace and is sensitive to the trailing spaces in the appended literal.
  - Recommendation: Let `RenderAccessModifier` handle indentation explicitly, or structure the builder calls so indentation is always deliberate and consistent (reduce reliance on trailing spaces in string literals).

- Property shape hard-coded (`{ get; }`):
  - For properties, the generator emits `{ get; }` which forbids `init`/setters. This may be intended, but it removes flexibility for cases where a private setter or `init` is desired while still treating it as a key member.
  - Recommendation: Ensure this is aligned with analyzer rules and intended immutability. If not, consider allowing `private init;` for records/immutable types as per project conventions.

- XML documentation wording:
  - The summary uses “The identifier of this item/object.” For value objects, “value” or “key” may be more appropriate terminology. Inconsistent wording may mislead consumers and tooling relying on docs.
  - Recommendation: Standardize wording across smart enums (“item”) and value objects (“value”/“key”) based on project terminology guidance.
